Our team "Cost > 100k" designed a special algorithm to reduce the circuit cost based on the geometric property of the graph and won the Special Oracle Award  

Comments from the judges:
Team: Costs > 100k, cost = 15737
Their oracle design, which focuses on the geometric triangle of the graph, was exceptionally creative. With their oracle, they succeeded reduced the solution space dramatically. That is why the organizers have decided to award this team with a Special Oracle Award.
